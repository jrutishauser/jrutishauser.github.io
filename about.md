As you can see, I have a pretty long name, which has given me a lot of nicknames
in my lifetime. Most people will tell you I have a lot of hobbies and I tend to
dive head first into those hobbies, from brewing beer to whitewater kayaking to
playing with web apps and new tech.

Much like with hobbies, I enjoy learning new types of tools for development and
I tinker with new languages both professionally and in my personal time. To
date, I have explored HTML, CSS, Sass, Less, Javascript, Angular, Node, Ember,
React, Ruby on Rails, Python and my newest interest, Elixir. My workflow
includes using Git and Github and I love using Vim and Tmux. I enjoy following
community releases that extend these tools make them even more enjoyable to use.

I spend my free time with my wife, Ally, and our two kids. Before making the
career shift to development, my background was in sales and sales management. If
you are interested in contacting me, feel free to do so on any of the platforms
