	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		<p>I’m Jonathan Rutishauser. As you can see, I have a pretty long name,
	   	which has given me a lot of nicknames in my lifetime- Rutis, JRu, Jon… 
		I’ll answer to any of them. Most people will tell you I have a lot of 
		hobbies and I tend to dive head first into those hobbies, from brewing 
		beer to whitewater kayaking to computer programming. Over the past decade, 
		programming has always piqued my interest and until recently, remained 
		just another hobby. I spend my free time with my wife, Ally, and our 
		goofy 6-year-old daughter, Averie. After spending the last 8 years in 
		sales and sales management, I decided it was time for a major career 
		change. I signed up for The Iron Yard’s Front End Engineering Program 
		and haven’t looked back since.</p> 

		<p>So why do you need me? I love to tinker with just about anything and 
		I’ve found that programming is a true passion for me. Creating awesome 
		projects with the skills I’ve learned through Front End Engineering is 
		exactly what I’m good at. I am genuinely excited to learn new ways to 
		create with JavaScript and learn about all of its many frameworks. Ever 
		since starting with Angular.js, I have been hooked. I am also skilled 
		with HTML, CSS and Sass and if I need a new tool to accomplish a goal, 
		I set out on a mission to find it.</p>
