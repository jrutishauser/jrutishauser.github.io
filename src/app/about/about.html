					I’m Jonathan Rutishauser. As you can see, I have a pretty 
					long name, which has given me a lot of nicknames in my 
					lifetime- Rutis, JRu, Jon… Most people will tell you I have 
					a lot of hobbies and I tend to dive head first into those hobbies, 
					from brewing beer to whitewater kayaking to computer programming. 
					Over the past decade, programming has always piqued my interest 
					and until recently, remained just another hobby. I spend my free 
					time with my wife, Ally, and our goofy 6-year-old daughter, 
					Averie. After spending the last 8 years in sales and sales 
					management, I decided it was time for a major career change. 
					I signed up for The Iron Yard’s Front End Engineering Program 
					and haven’t looked back since.</p>
				<h3>So why do you need me?</h3> 
			<p class='abouttext'>
			I love to tinker with just about anything and 
			I’ve found that programming is a true passion for me. Creating awesome 
			projects with the skills I’ve learned through Front End Engineering is 
			exactly what I’m good at. I am genuinely excited to learn new ways to 
			create with JavaScript and learn about all of its many frameworks. Ever 
			since starting with Angular.js, I have been hooked. I am also skilled 
			with HTML, CSS, jQuery and Sass and if I need a new tool to accomplish 
			a goal, I set out on a mission to find it.</p>
