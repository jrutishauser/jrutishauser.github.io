				<h3>Colorclock</h3>
				<p>The colorclock was a homework assignment at The Iron Yard. 
				The assignment was to build a live clock that also changes the 
				color
				of the background of the website using Javascript. After
				completing the Javscript portion I wanted to add some style to 
				the clock. I always was fascinated by designers making everyday
				objects out of just CSS. For this project I decided to attempt 
				making an iPhone using just CSS. View my colorclock
