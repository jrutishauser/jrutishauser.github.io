		   		A classmate and I noticed there was no chrome extension for a
				rubber duck. We decided this extension HAD to exist so we threw
				this extension together and added it to the chrome extension store.
				While not technically challenging to build it has received only
				5 star reviews.

			<p class='abouttext'>
				Rubber ducking is an informal term used in software 
				engineering for a method of debugging code. The name is a reference 
				to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer 
				would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing 
				themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.
