It's official, I'm two weeks in and the first blog post is up. No amount of discussion could have prepared me for the amount of work involved when starting The Iron Yard. I had some web experience from about a decade ago and spent the last few months using Code School, but I still find myself awake until two or three in the morning to add the final touches to each project. No matter how simple the project seems to be, there always seems to end up being some curve ball that needs to be solved to make each project presentable.

In this time, I have easily logged at least 160 hours of time on my laptop, frantically googling and using trial and error. I've been improving a lot on terminal and CSS with all the time I've put in, so I can't wait to put those skills to use and get going on JavaScript. It's awesome to learn about new tools such as Yeoman, HTML5 Boilerplate, Pretzo and Git with Github. The number of tools that are available to all developers at no cost is mind-blowing.

After just two short weeks, it has become apparent how much more I have picked up, which at least makes the exhaustion and frustration seem worthwhile...most of the time, haha.
