#### Migrated from my original blog to this new one.

Just finished running through the codeschool.com lesson on node.js called
‘Real-time Web with Node.js’

While it was great the last few lessons were a little bit hard for me to
completely grasp. I ran through and finished them but I am more of a hands on
type of person for learning. A classmate suggested ‘Learn You Node’ to me
available here [https://www.npmjs.com/package/learnyounode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/learnyounode) and it has been great.
This hands on problem solving with actual results is exactly what I needed.
After I finish this I plan to go back to Code School for the ‘soup to bits’
where you build a node app.
