This week we at The Iron Yard we got started on JavaScript. The more I get into it, the more there seems to be to learn. I created a simple game of chess that can be launched via Node on our terminal command line. Basically, by creating a line of several arrays, “pieces” can be moved by writing a function that copies the piece at the occupied space to a new space and replaces the old piece with an empty space. Not that pretty to look at, but it was fun to mess around with and create something like a chess game while only knowing so little of a language. Each project helps me to solve various issues with a very limited tool bag of skills available to me. Can't wait to see what I'll pick up in in the next week.
